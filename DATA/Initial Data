We used this Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions
We downloaded the two datasets called RAW_ interactions and RAW_recipes.
Then we performed data cleaning to obtain our final dataset that can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rd5zvJIbr5yocya-hBraDbD2LVNurP-G/view?usp=sharing
